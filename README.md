# Vehicle-Detection Using OpenCV

## Introduction 

In this project, we will detect the vehicles from a streaming video.
We will implement the same using the Haar Cascade classifier. Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001.

This is basically a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of images both positive and negative. Based on the training it is then used to detect the objects in the other images.
