# Vehicle-Detection Using OpenCV

## Introduction 

In this project, we will detect the vehicles from a streaming video.
We will implement the same using the Haar Cascade classifier. Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001.

This is basically a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of images both positive and negative. Based on the training it is then used to detect the objects in the other images.

## About the project
The project aims to detect multiple cars in the video frames from the video given by the user.

## Technologies used
* Python
* OpenCV 
* Haar Cascades 
* Numpy

## How to use
* Open the project in Google Colab.
* Upload all the files from Github to Colab.
* Hit Run.

## Use cases
* Can be used by self-driving vehicles to detect cars around it.
* An advanced traffic signal system that uses the number of vehicles to switch lights instead of hardcoded values of the time.
